# Local development

These instructions should get you set up ready to work ðŸ’ª

## Getting Started

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install `yarn`: `npm install -g yarn`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`

Highly recommend to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing on any platform.

## Recommended `node` setup

In order to have more consistent builds, we use a strict `node` and `npm` version as defined in the `package.json` `engines` field and `.nvmrc` file. `yarn install` will fail if you do not use the version defined, so it is recommended to install `node` via `nvm` for easy node version management. Automatic `node` version switching can be installed for [`zsh`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh) or [`bash`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) using `nvm`.

## Running the boilerplate ðŸš€

- To run the **app**: `yarn run dev`
